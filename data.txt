Canada, Mexico and the US have deeply integrated economies, with an estimated $2bn (£1.6bn) worth of manufactured goods crossing the borders daily.

There's a lot at stake here.

The Canadian Chamber of Commerce said the levies would have "immediate and direct consequences on Canadian and American livelihoods" and will "drastically increase the cost of everything for everyone".

The car manufacturing sector could be especially hard hit. Parts cross the US, Canadian and Mexican borders multiple times before a final vehicle is assembled.

TD Economics suggested the import taxes could push up the average US car price by around $3,000, while the National Homebuilders Association said housing costs could increase.

Economists have warned the introduction of the import taxes by the US, and the responses from other countries, could lead to prices rising on a wide range of products, from cars, lumber, and steel to food and alcohol.
