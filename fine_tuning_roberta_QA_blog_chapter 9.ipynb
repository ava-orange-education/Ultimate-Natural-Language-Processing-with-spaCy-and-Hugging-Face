              "'When I saw \"Spider-Man 3\" on opening night, I was really let down. How could a film with great-looking villains, amazing special effects, and Peter turning to the dark side, be bad? Well, for one thing, as great as the villains and special effects looked, they lacked heart and soul. As for Peter becoming more hostile and evil, the filmmakers decided to make a joke out of it and the whole storyline lost its punch. Also, by adding more, useless Peter Parker/Mary Jane Watson/Harry Osborn drama, the story became bloated, routine, and at times, boring. \"Spider-Man 3\" was the weakest of the trilogy.After finally watching the film for a second time, I found the film slightly more tolerable(mainly because I knew what I was in for). It still contained the same problems though. First, the storyline is filled with too many stories that are connected in totally unbelievable ways. Second, even though the audience has been close with the characters the last two films, Peter Parker, M.J. Watson, and others seem very one-dimensional here. Finally, when the film should have been serious, it opted for a more funny tone (which, ironically, I found not funny at all). Even though I have my complaints about the film, there are many parts that I did enjoy, mainly the special effects and fight scenes, James Franco\\'s and Thomas Haden Church\\'s performances, and in my opinion, the greatest scene of the trilogy, the creation of Sandman. These aspects elevate the film from being a waste of time.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is loving life. He has the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), he\\'s doing well in school, and most importantly, his alter-ego, Spider-Man is finally being revered for all his hard work. Regardless of all the good things happening to him, there is still a lot he needs to deal with.First, his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), knows he is Spider-Man and still places the death of his father in the web-slinger\\'s hands. Harry eventually dons a new version of the Goblin suit, hoping to get revenge.Second, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), the actual killer of Peter\\'s loving uncle, escapes prison and ends up falling into a science experiment that turns him into the Sandman.Third, M.J. begins to move away from Peter to Harry. After her show does poorly and she\\'s fired from the role, she begins to dislike Peter because of the success he is receiving as Spider-Man. When M.J. turns to Harry, Harry decides to use to his advantage to make Peter miserable.Four, an alien symbiote lands on Earth and similar to a parasite, uses Peter\\'s suit as a host. When he dons his new black suit, he becomes more powerful, but at the same time, more aggressive and volatile. Once he finally gets rid of the symbiote, it finds a new host: Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who becomes supervillain, Venom.Five...Six...Seven...Eight...The script is a mess. Besides what I mentioned above, there are many other stories in the film that deal with both Peter and Spider-Man. The main issue I have with the script is that it consists of coincidences. It\\'s a coincidence that Spider-Man is fighting the villain, Sandman, who also happened to kill Peter Parker\\'s uncle. It\\'s a coincidence that the alien symbiote from space landed ten feet away from Peter instead of somewhere else on the planet. It\\'s a coincidence that when Spider-Man rips himself free of the symbiote, his rival at the Daily Bugle, Eddie Brock, is right below him in some random church and then becomes Venom. Once he\\'s Venom, it\\'s a coincidence he knows that M.J. is Peter\\'s love interest even though he\\'s never seen her or the two together before. \"Spider-Man 3\" is ridded with all these situations that are unbelievable in terms of story and make the film much longer than needed.Maybe I\\'m being a tad harsh. After all, the film is based off a comic book. Yet, this doesn\\'t excuse the poorly written characters. The audience has already learned and cared a lot about Peter Parker and M.J, but the third film does nothing new with them. Even though they are together, they are still having tough times to work things out, which I find quite annoying. At the end of \"Spider-Man 2,\" M.J. knew what she was getting into by being with Peter and how he wouldn\\'t always be around for her physically. In this film, she pouts and whines, because Peter is never there for her, making the ending to the great \"Spider-Man 2\" look pointless. I wished that in this chapter they would have just been a happy couple and had M.J. more in the background of the story.In a superhero film, the villains are usually the most interesting and the fun part of the film is when our hero fights them. The problem with \"Spider-Man 3\" is that the villains are similar to their characters on a comic book page: flat. As cool as both of the main villains are, they lack any depth or real characterization. All the audience knows about Sandman is that he killed Uncle Ben and now he searches for money to help his daughter get better from some sickness. That\\'s it. The most hurtful part of the film is that the coolest villain in the Spider-man universe, Venom, gets reduced to fifteen minutes of screen time. What\\'s even worse is that he doesn\\'t have a long tongue or a muscular body frame like the comics, but instead looks like black Spider-Man with a mouth like a raptor and a face that changes from the raptor mouth to Eric Foreman\\'s face...I mean, Eddie Brock\\'s face. Venom is just there. There\\'s no real purpose for him to be in the story. If I had had my way, I would have let the ending of this one be Brock changing into Venom. That way, Sandman would have more time to develop as a character and then Venom could have his own film with Spider-Man. By throwing too many villains into the pot, the film suffers.My final problem with the film is the humor placed throughout. In the first two \"Spider-Man\" films, I laughed with the film when intentional, but in \"Spider-Man 3,\" I found myself laughing at what was happening on screen. Peter\\'s transformation to the dark side is what I\\'m referring to. What should have been a serious moment in the film becomes incredibly stupid. For instance, when he walks down the street, he breaks out into dance and \"Saturday Night Fever\" type moves. It\\'s really embarrassing. As I watched that scene, I cringed, wanting it to be over as fast as I could, but it goes on for a good five minutes unfortunately. Other \"funny\" moments throughout take the viewer out of the film, especially at the moments when the viewer is supposed to be most engaged in what\\'s going on.Now, I can finally get on to what I did like about the film. First, the special effects are dazzling. If anything has improved throughout all the films, it\\'s the effects. Sure, Spider-Man is still a computer\\'s creation when slinging around New York, but he felt much more believable this time around. Second, the action scenes are well-done and plentiful. None are overlong (even though, Venom\\'s should have been), but they are well shot and edited, especially the Sandman and Spider-Man fight in the underground. Third, the performances by James Franco and Thomas Haden Church are top-notch. While the film suffers from bad writing, these two are the only actors that truly make the most of it. Franco brings a much-needed warmth and charm to the film and his character stands out the most. Even though Sandman isn\\'t a well-developed character, Church really makes the most out of it, which brings me to the best part of the film: the creation of Sandman.Watching grains of sand slowly come together to form Flint Marko is a spectacle. Even though it\\'s totally unrealistic, the special effects team along with the help of Thomas Haden Church, make the scene believable. As Marko tries to form, he stumbles and chunks of sand fall away. Once he realizes what he\\'s becomes, his face of sand changes expressions and with the aid of Christopher Young\\'s score, the scene is just beautiful and breath-taking. It\\'s my favorite scene in the entire trilogy. If the film had more scenes that had great special effects balanced with heart, then it would have been amazing.Overall, \"Spider-Man 3\" is the weakest of the trilogy. It was the one I was looking forward to the most, but was let down due to the script, characters, and the humor. Thankfully, the special effects, action, a few performances, and the creation of a villain were able to make it a better film and redeem it from being a waste of celluloid. ANSWERNOTFOUND'"
