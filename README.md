## About the Book
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is at the core of modern AI, powering everything from chatbots to recommendation systems. “Ultimate Natural Language Processing with spaCy and Hugging Face” is a practical guide that takes you from essential NLP foundations to advanced transformer models and large language applications, equipping you to build real-world AI projects with confidence.
 
You begin with the fundamentals—tokenization, lemmatization, Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, embeddings, POS tagging, and Named Entity Recognition—and apply them to practical use cases such as sentiment analysis, topic classification, and text classification. 

The book then moves into Deep Learning for NLP with hands-on coding of CNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs, progressing from theory to applied projects. spaCy is explored in depth, with guidance on building and customizing pipelines for NER, POS tagging, and sentiment analysis. Real-world projects, including extracting dates and events from news articles, ensure that every concept connects to practical applications.
 
The journey concludes with Hugging Face and transformers, where you train and fine-tune models for summarization, classification, and recommendation. Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, Llama, and Claude are introduced alongside efficient training techniques like LoRA and Retrieval-Augmented Generation. By the end, you will gain the confidence to design and deploy responsible AI-powered solutions.
